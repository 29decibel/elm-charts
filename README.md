# Elm Plot

Plot stuff in SVG with Elm!

## Overview

So, in the spirit of Elm and its goal of not only being a tool to express yourself elegantly,
but also help you do so, this library tried to guide you towards nice plots. Of course, it's not only my
own preferences, but also a guy called [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) who wrote
the book [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and had a
lot of great ideas of how to make plots more readable. However, if you find that these restrictions are keeping you
from doing something incredible vital, then lets talk about it and see if it makes sense to allow it.

### What does the api look like?

Something like this:

```elm
    main =
      viewSeries
        [ area (List.map (\{ x, y } -> circle x y)) ]
        [ { x = 0, y = 1 }
        , { x = 2, y = 2 }
        , { x = 3, y = 3 }
        , { x = 4, y = 5 }
        , { x = 5, y = 8 }
        ]
```

You're welcome to take a look at the docs folder for more [exampels](https://github.com/terezka/elm-plot/tree/master/docs)!
